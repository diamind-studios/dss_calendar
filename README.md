# dss_calendar
A simple way of calculating the day of the year of a given date in our modern Gregorian calendars according to the Essene calendar found in the Dead Sea Scrolls

This project was developed following the findings of Ken Johnson, using a 364 day calendar year which begins on the first wednesday before or on March 22nd. All code in the repository is original.

## Usage
- The included main.py is to provide an example. Simply change the "test_date" variable to your desired date and run main.py with python, and it will print out the DSS date according to the Essene calendar. 
- Alternatively, import into your own project following the example in main.py, and integrate it however you would like.
